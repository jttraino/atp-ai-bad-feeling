# Your AI Program Has a Bad Feeling About This

Public archive for the ATP event "Your AI Program Has a Bad Feeling About This." It's an interactive workshop on why enterprise AI initiatives fail, run as the honest, hands-on debrief nobody runs at their own company.

## Format

Attendees split into five themed stations (about 25 people each), each covering a distinct way enterprise AI programs go wrong:

| Station | Theme |
|---|---|
| [Sky City](stations/sky-city/) | Infrastructure and integration challenges with third-party tools |
| [Swamp Planet](stations/swamp-planet/) | Technical debt and data quality issues |
| [Ice Planet](stations/ice-planet/) | Development-stage use cases stuck in limbo |
| [Snow Monster Cave](stations/snow-monster-cave/) | Unexpected costs and security vulnerabilities |
| [Asteroid Field](stations/asteroid-field/) | Compliance, legal obstacles, and scope creep |

Each station is a guided discussion, not a talk: the station sponsor puts a list of roughly eight questions to their station and the room answers. Fleet Command hosts, records, and transcribes each one via an independent Teams meeting, not the sponsor, and every station has an Astromech whose only job is to watch that the capture is actually working. No one in any single station gets the full picture. That's the point of what comes next.

Immediately afterward, the group reassembles for **the Throne Room**, the closeout session. Everyone who fought the battle in a different ship, back in one room at the end. It has the high ground: the one vantage point that actually sees the patterns across all five stations at once, distilled into shared talking points. See [`closeout/`](closeout/).

This repo documents the full method, not just the output. That includes [how the Throne Room deck was actually synthesized](tools/synthesize-closeout/) from the five station transcripts in the few minutes between sessions ending and the group reassembling, and [the rehearsal harness](tests/) we used to run the whole night end to end beforehand, including every way it could fail.

## Take this and run it yourself

**[RUN-THIS-YOURSELF.md](RUN-THIS-YOURSELF.md)** is the transferable part: ten principles that made the closeout session reliable enough to present unreviewed in front of a hundred people, each with the code that implements it and the defect it caught, followed by how to run the event format at your own organization.

The short version, since the event is about why enterprise AI programs fail and it would be embarrassing to run it on one that does: be deterministic wherever determinism is available, never ask a model a question you can already answer, constrain the output until a machine can validate it, write the evals before the night and test the disasters, score the things you would otherwise argue about, and measure instead of estimating.

Pull requests are welcome. Corrections to a transcript, additional context on a station's topic, or your own notes if you were in the room are all fair game. This is meant to be a living record of the event, not a frozen archive.
