# Every scenario runs the real tools against real files: intake from a mock
# Downloads folder, synthesis, schema validation, deck build. Nothing is mocked
# except the model itself, and the model stub is swapped to rehearse its failures
# too. Timings are measured, not estimated.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/rehearse.sh                 run every scenario
#   tests/rehearse.sh happy mixed     run named scenarios
#   tests/rehearse.sh --keep happy    keep the scratch dir and print its path
#   REAL_MODEL=1 tests/rehearse.sh happy    use the actual claude CLI
