"""A deterministic stand-in for the `claude` CLI, so the rehearsal can run the whole
pipeline hundreds of times without spending tokens or waiting on a network.

It reads the same prompt the real model would get, works out which stations are on a
transcript and which are on a fallback, and emits schema-valid JSON. Behaviour is
selected by STUB_MODE so the harness can rehearse the failure paths too:

  good      valid JSON, correct sources                  (the happy path)
  fenced    valid JSON wrapped in ```json plus chatter    (what models actually do)
  garbage   an apology, no JSON at all
  badschema JSON that is well formed but breaks the rules (a dropped station)
  liar      marks a fallback station as a transcript      (the dangerous one)
  fail      exits nonzero, as a crashed or rate-limited CLI would
