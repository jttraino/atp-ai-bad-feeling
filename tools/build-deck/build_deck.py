"""Turn a validated JSON payload into the self-contained Throne Room deck.

The model's only job is content: a lede, some points, and a takeaway per station,
plus the cross-cutting patterns. Everything else about the deck (structure, order,
branding, the method screens, the QR code, navigation) is generated here, in code,
where it cannot vary between runs.

That split is deliberate and it is the whole reliability argument:
  - The model does the part that genuinely needs judgment.
  - Code does the part that has one correct answer.
  - Invalid model output is rejected outright, and an existing deck is never
    overwritten with something that failed validation.

Usage:
