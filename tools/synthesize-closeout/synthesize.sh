# Builds the Throne Room deck from whatever is currently sitting in stations/*/,
# and writes it to closeout/presentation.html.
#
# For each station, in priority order, it uses:
#   1. transcript.md / transcript.txt   the real transcript, plain text
#   2. transcript.docx                  converted via pandoc, if pandoc is installed
#   3. questions.md                     the question list plus pre-filled likely answers,
#                                        used as a fallback if no transcript was captured
# A station with none of the above is a hard error: we do not ship a deck that
# silently drops a station.
#
# The model is asked for JSON, not for a deck. The JSON is validated against a
# schema before anything is rendered, and a run that fails validation leaves the
# existing deck exactly where it was.
#
# Env:
#   CLAUDE_BIN    model CLI to invoke (default: claude)
#   MODE          live | seeded  (default: live)
#   PRIMARY_MODEL model for the good answer (default: the CLI's own default)
#   FAST_MODEL    standby model for the hedge (default: haiku)
#   HEDGE         on | off  (default: on).  --no-hedge does the same thing.
#   DEADLINE_S    how long the primary gets before we prefer the standby (default: 180)
#   GRACE_S       extra time to wait for the standby after that (default: 45)
#   VOICES        comma separated character voices, or empty for none (default: none)
#   VOICE_MODEL   model for the voice passes (default: the primary)
#   FOLLOW_URL    published URL of the deck. Every screen shows a QR to its own anchor
#                 so the room can follow along on a phone. Empty string turns it off.
#
# Flags:
#   --no-hedge            one model only, half the tokens, no insurance
#   --voices[=a,b,c]      add character voices; default set is yoda,vader,threepio
#   --no-voices           explicit off
#   --deadline SECONDS
#   --follow-url URL      override the published URL shown in the QR on every screen
#   --no-follow           no QR, no follow-along link

# Two requests in parallel, and deliberately NOT a race. The primary gets the whole
# deadline to itself; the standby is only used if the primary misses it or comes back
# unusable. A pure race would hand the room a weaker deck whenever the standby happened
# to finish fifteen seconds earlier, which is the opposite of what we want.
#
# They run at the same time rather than in sequence because a serial retry costs you
# the primary's entire deadline before the standby has even started. The measured
# spread on the primary is 69 to 164 seconds, so a serial fallback can put you past
# four minutes. In parallel, the worst case is about the deadline.
#
# What it buys, in order of how likely you are to need it:
#   1. Tail latency. Two calls go slow independently.
#   2. A second, independent attempt at valid output if the primary returns nonsense.
#   3. Nothing whatsoever if the venue network is down or the account is rate limited.
#      Both paths share those. That is what the seeded deck is for.
